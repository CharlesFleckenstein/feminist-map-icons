# The three roles from docs/permissions.md, as Django Groups.
# Role membership is a group, never is_staff: moderators need is_staff to reach the
# Django admin, so treating that flag as a role would also hand them publish rights.

CONTRIBUTOR = "Contributor"
MODERATOR = "Moderator"
ADMIN = "Admin"

# Django admin permissions per role, written as "app_label.codename", so the groups are
# useful in the admin too. Publishing is a status value, not a model permission, so
# "approve but don't publish" can only be expressed in the API.
#
# Only Admin gets the auth.User rights, which is how contributor accounts get approved
# until the real workflow lands. Moderators are left out on purpose even though the matrix
# gives them account approval: the admin's user form exposes is_superuser, groups and
# user_permissions, so auth.change_user lets the holder promote themselves and take the
# publish right this whole module exists to withhold. Approving an account without that
# escalation needs a narrow action of our own, not Django's edit-everything form.
